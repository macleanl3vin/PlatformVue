# Techsmart Platform
------------------------------------------------------------
## What is this? 
This is an Industry Authentic full-stack web app I developed during the summer of 2023 in an internship with Techsmart a software development company. This project focused on assisting teachers in managing their daily lesson plans and lesson notes more effectively. 
Over the course of the internship I completed the following milestones:


Milestone 1: Build a Responsive Web Page.
- Create a responsive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Use design information from Figma to structure and style the page.
  - Populate the lesson plan content with JavaScript objects.
--------------------------------------------------
Milestone 2: Extend the Page with a Dynamic Lesson Plan
- Allow teachers to rearrange activities in their lesson plans using responsive down/up buttons.
  - Implement backend integration using REST APIs to save changes.
  - Solve the challenge of inflexible lesson plan reordering.
--------------------------------------------------
Milestone 3: Extend the Page with a Lesson Notes Editor
- Add a Markdown editor for editing lesson notes.
  - Save edited notes to the backend database.
  - Address the issue of outdated lesson notes management.
--------------------------------------------------
Milestone 4: Decompose the Page into Components
- Refactor the web page into modular Vue components.
  - Utilize Vue 3 and Vite for more efficient development.
  - Prepare for future feature additions and maintenance.
--------------------------------------------------
Milestone 5: Integrate the Page with a Serverless Database
- Integrate the web page with Google Cloud Firestore.
  - Use VueFire for data synchronization.
  - Reduce inefficiencies by adopting a serverless database.
  - Provide real-time updates and improved data storage.
--------------------------------------------------
### Throughout the project, various technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Vue 3, VueFire, and Google Cloud Firestore are used. The tools I used In this project inlcude replit as my IDE, Figma for UI documentation. This project aims to create a user-friendly platform for teachers, while my showcasing software development skills, including responsive design, data-driven approaches, component-based architecture, and integration with a serverless database.
