  - Address the issue of outdated lesson notes management.
--------------------------------------------------
Milestone 4: Decompose the Page into Components
- Refactor the web page into modular Vue components.
  - Utilize Vue 3 and Vite for more efficient development.
  - Prepare for future feature additions and maintenance.
--------------------------------------------------
Milestone 5: Integrate the Page with a Serverless Database
